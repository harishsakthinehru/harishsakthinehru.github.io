      <description>At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic’s arrival, closures and delays at ports and border crossings, as well as rest stops and welcome centers played havoc for supply chain professionals and logistics providers. Border crossings in particular, which were already notoriously difficult for logistics providers to predict, were especially impacted by COVID-related delays as the borders were being closed abruptly and without prior warning.
Working around the clock, we quickly built out a dashboard providing real-time insights into transit times at national border crossings around the world.</description>

      <description>As part of Analytics team, we were responsible for reporting and gathering insights. Considering the huge volume of our data, we had to prepare datamarts in our data warehouse and push them to the in-memory data stores used by Viz tools Tableau and Sisense.
We had multi-tenancy architecture, so data security and integrity played a critical role. In order to achieve that, I had integrated the complete life-cycle of an user and company in our platform with the Row Level Security and ACLs in the in-memory stores.</description>

      <description>Zoho used to manage all the DNS servers, internal and external zone files manually. Considering the scale of the applications running in Zoho&amp;rsquo;s Data centers spanning continents, proactive measures had to be in place in case of any unforeseen disasters. Manual measures did not have the agility and always had a risk of human-error causing complete outages.
We came up with an idea of building a tool, which would completely own this piece of Infrastructure and elevate the NOC team to take up other challenging tasks.</description>
