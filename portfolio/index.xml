      <description>At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic’s arrival, closures and delays at ports and border crossings, as well as rest stops and welcome centers played havoc for supply chain professionals and logistics providers. Border crossings in particular, which were already notoriously difficult for logistics providers to predict, were especially impacted by COVID-related delays as the borders were being closed abruptly and without prior warning.
Working around the clock, we quickly built out a dashboard providing real-time insights into transit times at national border crossings around the world.</description>

      <description>As the user base was more diverse with different types of roles, the metrics that each user would be interested in varied depending on their role in the part of Logistics. Instead of showing a single pre-built dashboard for all types of executives, we had to make it more customizable and user-friendly.
Started with requirement gathering and after identifying the base data sources, I started working on volume analysis and brought in realistic assumptions for the projected scale based on data growth trend.</description>

      <title>Licensing Framework</title>

      <description>Granting an user access to multi-layered features was difficult and to control the privileges at company licenses, packaging capability, user interface and feature level was very challenging to manage manually.
Licensing framework was a robust design to overcome this and scale easily across different products, capabilities, interfaces and features. This gave a fine grained control over access provisioning, where once the licenses are set up, the customers can add any user to any features and manage the full control themselves.</description>

      <description>In order to avoid buffer overflows, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Unvalidated Input vulnerability, SQL injection and dirty-data, I came up with a generic security framework for all Ruby-based microservices.
It was designed as a generic regex-based multi-level nested input validation system, which gives complete control over the data that in getting ingested into the system. The developers had to specify a regex policy for the incoming requests&#39; params and the framework will act as a middleware scrutinizing the input before forwarding it to the API controller.</description>

      <description>As part of Analytics team, we were responsible for reporting and gathering insights. Considering the huge volume of our data, we had to prepare datamarts in our data warehouse and push them to the in-memory data stores used by Viz tools Tableau and Sisense.
We had multi-tenancy architecture, so data security and integrity played a critical role. In order to achieve that, I had integrated the complete life-cycle of an user and company in our platform with the Row Level Security and ACLs in the in-memory stores.</description>

      <title>DNS Management Tool</title>

      <description>Zoho used to manage all the DNS servers, internal and external zone files manually. Considering the scale of the applications running in Zoho&amp;rsquo;s Data centers spanning continents, proactive measures had to be in place in case of any unforeseen disasters. Manual measures did not have the agility and always had a risk of human-error causing complete outages.
We came up with an idea of building a tool, which would completely own this piece of Infrastructure and elevate the NOC team to take up other challenging tasks.</description>
